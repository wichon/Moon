Coder, Ops guy.

My name is Luis Alonzo (AKA Wichon) from Guatemala, most of my professional time (9 years to be exact) I have been working as a developer in a wide range of platforms and technologies incluiding php, python, c#, java, js, coffescript and lately bash and some powershell. In the last years I switched to a SysAdmin/DevOps role which I love.

I consider myself a quick learner and passionate about what I do, always looking for new things to learn. I work a lot with cloud technologies and consider myself proficient in Amazon AWS, I just love how the cloud has managed to simplify systems administration like Lego blocks.

My hobbies include weight lifting (You know to release some steam and stuff), playing video games, socially drinking or just been a couch potato.

Take some time to check my [GitHub](https://github.com/wichon) hopefully you may found something useful there.

I lost memory on how many times I've tried to start a blog, some of those attempts didn't pass from the Hello World post, I hope this time it does.

The objective of this blog is to talk about code, automation, systems administration and random stuff. 

I always do things that I say to myself: "I should write this somewhere so if I have to do it again, it will be easier", hope this blog is that place, so I dont end going to google and search for the same problems and find a stack overflow answer or a blog post I'd already checked some time ago.

Hopefully someone will find something useful or entertaining here.
